# show-finder
Description:
show-finder is a service that helps people find local acts and the venues to see them.

This service will allow bands, venues, and users to post information about a show. I hope to address common questions users would have, such as:
1. Is there a show near me? 
2. Is there a cover charge?
3. Does the venue serve alcohol?
4. Can I let people know about a show?
